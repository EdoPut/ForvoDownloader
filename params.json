This module require the [Requests module][3] to operate, install it from the python package index  before.\r\n\r\nThere is only a function to call and it requires 3 arguments, other are default values.\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        import ForvoDownloader as forvo\r\n        \r\n        links = forvo.ForvoRequest(QUERY, LANG, apikey, ACT='word-pronunciations', FORMAT='mp3' free=TRUE)\r\n        ```\r\n* QUERY\r\n* LANG\r\n* apikey\r\n\r\nare mandatory.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to play around and implement other ACTIONS described in the [forvo API docs][4].\r\n\r\nLanguage must be a code from [this list][5]. Example: 'English' -> 'en', 'French'  ->'fr'\r\n\r\nExample\r\n=======\r\nThis is not an executable file so you need to know at least a little Python to get thing up and running.\r\n<strong>This script requires Requests to run. Get requests [here][3].</strong>\r\n\r\n1. Get the [test.py][1] and [forvo.py][2] scripts.\r\n2. Get an APIKEY from [Forvo][4]. You can sign for the free plan which allows you to make 500 requests per day.\r\nCreate a new file named apikey.txt and paste your APIKEY in it, save it and <b>place it in the same folder as the test.py script</b>.\r\n3. Get a list of the words you want the script to check for on Forvo. It must be a plain-text file with one word per line.\r\n4. The syntax to execute the test.py is: ```\r\n            Main('Language',limit)\r\n            ```\r\n   You can find it on the bottom of the script.\r\n5. Run the test.py script and choose your file from the dialog window.\r\n6. Search the downloaded files in /user/forvo, there will be a different folder for each language.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously you can put more than a word per line and it will search for the entire phrase and whichever is the top rated will be downloaded, even if it's not the phrase you're looking for.\r\n\r\nTo do\r\n=====\r\n\r\n- [x] Wrap everything into a separate module\r\n- [ ] Write a wiki\r\n\r\n  [1]: /test.py   \"test.py\"\r\n  [2]: /forvo.py  \"forvo.py\"\r\n  [3]: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ \"Requests latest\"\r\n  [4]: http://api.forvo.com \"Forvo API\"\r\n  [5]: http://www.forvo.com/languages/alphabetically/ \"Forvo languages list\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
